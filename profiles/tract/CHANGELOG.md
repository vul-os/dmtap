# Changelog

All notable changes to the TRACT specification. This project uses semantic versioning for the
document: MAJOR for wire-incompatible changes, MINOR for additive sections, PATCH for corrections
that change no bytes.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-21

Initial draft. Nothing here is normative yet except §0.

### Normative

- **§16 (wire format) frozen at v0.** The CDDL for every TRACT object, promoted from proposal to
  requirement. Freezing is a commitment to stability rather than a claim of correctness: the shapes
  are implemented and exercised end to end, which proves they compose and does not prove they are
  right, since an implementation and a grammar derived from each other only agree with each other.
  §16.8 still lists what is undecided above the byte level.

### Added

- **§22 (erasure)** — the erasure-rights conflict stated exactly rather than solved: why §0.5.1's
  structural exclusion is stronger than any deletion mechanism, the three candidate mechanisms for
  the residual with their honest limits, the unresolved controller question, and a closing note
  that this needs legal advice rather than another literature pass.
- **`docs/DECISION-vat-facilitator.md`** — options and a recommendation on the EU VAT
  deemed-supplier exposure. *(Committed alongside the §16 freeze rather than on its own; that
  commit's message does not mention it.)*

- **§0 Overview** — goals, non-goals, the DMTAP substrate adoption, roles, the single operator
  class, the public/sealed quadrant split, where state lives, the document map, and the normative
  glossary.
- **§1–§20** — scoped stubs. Each states what it will specify, which existing standards it
  profiles, and what is still open. They are marked non-normative and the linter enforces that they
  stay that way until deliberately promoted.
- **§21 Grounding** — a July 2026 adversarially-verified literature pass, recorded with its own
  coverage caveats, including the findings that contradict this specification.
- `tools/lint.py` — five checks (dangling section refs, document-map agreement, normative language
  in a stub, unmarked stub, reference cited but not listed).
- `build/` — markdown to PDF via headless Chrome, no LaTeX, inherited from the DMTAP build.

### Decided

- **One operator class**, the gateway (storefront rendering and/or settlement), rather than two.
  Bundling them matches how the standing that underwrites both is actually acquired.
- **Four axes** for every offer, rather than category-specific product types.
- **No personal data in the public quadrant**, because published objects are irrevocable and
  erasure rights cannot be satisfied against them.
- **Jurisdiction as a machine-readable field**, with four separate anchors — seller establishment,
  buyer residence, place of supply, delivery destination — because conflating them is the most
  common commerce-tax error and an event held abroad breaks any two-anchor model.
- **No network-wide published score**, because computing one requires the authority being removed.

### Known weakest points

Recorded rather than deferred, all in §21:

- Content addressing is a sound mechanism for product identity but an **unproven** solution;
  canonicalisation is where the real work is.
- "Any node may build an index" does not prevent one index becoming the de facto gatekeeper. This
  is the weakest load-bearing claim in the document.
- An offline seller is invisible, not merely slow.
- Opt-in escrow's measured failure mode is that bad actors decline it.
